CHI-SQUARE TEST

Association between Device Type and Customer Satisfaction
Background:
Mizzare Corporation has collected data on customer satisfaction levels for two types of smart home devices: Smart Thermostats and Smart Lights. They want to determine if there's a significant association between the type of device purchased and the customer's satisfaction level.
Data Provided:
The data is summarized in a contingency table showing the counts of customers in each satisfaction level for both types of devices:
Satisfaction	Smart Thermostat	Smart Light	Total

Very Satisfied	50	70	120

Satisfied	80	100	180

Neutral	60	90	150

Unsatisfied	30	50	80

Very Unsatisfied	20	50	70

Total	240	360	600

Objective:
To use the Chi-Square test for independence to determine if there's a significant association between the type of smart home device purchased (Smart Thermostats vs. Smart Lights) and the customer satisfaction level.
Assignment Tasks:
1. State the Hypotheses:
2. Compute the Chi-Square Statistic:
3. Determine the Critical Value:
Using the significance level (alpha) of 0.05 and the degrees of freedom (which is the number of categories minus 1)
4. Make a Decision:
Compare the Chi-Square statistic with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.


HYPOTHESIS TESTING

Background:
Bombay hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.
Objective:
To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.
Data Provided:
•	The theoretical weekly operating cost model: W = $1,000 + $5X
•	Sample of 25 restaurants with a mean weekly cost of Rs. 3,050
•	Number of units produced in a week (X) follows a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 600 units and a standard deviation (σ) of 25 units
Assignment Tasks:
1. State the Hypotheses statement:
2. Calculate the Test Statistic:
Use the following formula to calculate the test statistic (t):
where:
•	ˉxˉ = sample mean weekly cost (Rs. 3,050)
•	μ = theoretical mean weekly cost according to the cost model (W = $1,000 + $5X for X = 600 units)
•	σ = 5*25 units
•	n = sample size (25 restaurants)
3. Determine the Critical Value:
Using the alpha level of 5% (α = 0.05), determine the critical value from the standard normal (Z) distribution table.
4. Make a Decision:
Compare the test statistic with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
5. Conclusion:
Based on the decision in step 4, conclude whether there is strong evidence to support the restaurant owners' claim that the weekly operating costs are higher than the model suggests.
